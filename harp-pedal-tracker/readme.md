# Harp Pedal Tracker

This very simple Max project implements a simple version of Stanley
Chaloupka's[^1] harp pedal tracker, aiming at facilityting writing for harp.

Additionally, a simple Lisp program is included which implements a few simple
ways of working with the Salzedo pedals in 
[slippery chicken](http://github.com/mdedwards/slippery-chicken). 

## Usage

Launch `pedal-tracker.maxpat` (the main file) in order to work out your 
"pedalings". 

In order to use the pedalings with `harp.lisp`, copy the "Salzedo-List" from the
patch and use it in your Lisp-program.
