This is a simple approach to avoiding the disembodied performer problem when
musicians onstage are amplified and the direct signal reaches the listener at
the same time as the amplified signal from the loudspeaker. Of course this is a
complex issue and won't work in every listening position and/or gain
relationship situation, but it helps in practice for sure.

The idea is that you have an 8-channel equally-spaced pairs of loudspeakers,
left-right, front to back and you know the distance from the musician to the
front pair as well as the distance from the front pair to the back pair of
speakers. Delays will be calculated automatically. The intention is of course
that the direct signal from the musician arrives at the 'average' listeners'
ears after the amplified signal.

This is of course a very specific situation but the stereo-delay-meters patch
could be used as the basis of many other loudspeaker arrangements.
